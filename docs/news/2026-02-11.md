### LLM-FSM: Scaling Large Language Models for Finite-State Reasoning in RTL Code Generation

**来源**: arXiv CS.AI  
**时间**: Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500  
**链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07032

**摘要**: arXiv:2602.07032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-state reasoning, the ability to understand and implement state-dependent behavior, is central to hardware design. In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machi...

### Theory of Space: Can Foundation Models Construct Spatial Beliefs through Active Exploration?

**来源**: arXiv CS.AI  
**时间**: Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500  
**链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07055

**摘要**: arXiv:2602.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial embodied intelligence requires agents to act to acquire information under partial observability. While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We prop...

### PreFlect: From Retrospective to Prospective Reflection in Large Language Model Agents

**来源**: arXiv CS.AI  
**时间**: Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500  
**链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07187

**摘要**: arXiv:2602.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced large language model agents typically adopt self-reflection for improving performance, where agents iteratively analyze past actions to correct errors. However, existing reflective approaches are inherently retrospective: agents act, observe ...

### Is there "Secret Sauce'' in Large Language Model Development?

**来源**: arXiv CS.AI  
**时间**: Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 -0500  
**链接**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07238

**摘要**: arXiv:2602.07238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do leading LLM developers possess a proprietary ``secret sauce'', or is LLM performance driven by scaling up compute? Using training and benchmark data for 809 models released between 2022 and 2025, we estimate scaling-law regressions with release-dat...
