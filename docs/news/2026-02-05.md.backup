## 🎓 Academic Research (arXiv Papers)

### Understanding Agent Scaling in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems via Diversity

**arXiv**: 2602.03794 • Submitted: Feb 3, 2026

**Authors**: Shangding Gu et al.

**Key Contribution**: 2 diverse agents outperform 16 homogeneous agents in multi-agent systems.

**Abstract**: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex tasks that are difficult for individual LLMs. A natural strategy is to scale performance by increasing the number of agents; however, we find that such scaling exhibits strong diminishing returns in homogeneous settings, while introducing heterogeneity (e.g., different models, prompts, or tools) continues to yield substantial gains. This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents.

**Impact**: Provides principled guidelines for building efficient multi-agent systems through diversity-aware design, challenging the "more agents is better" paradigm.

### AOrchestra: Automating Sub-Agent Creation for Agentic Orchestration

**arXiv**: 2602.03786 • Submitted: Feb 3, 2026

**Authors**: Jianhao Ruan, Zhihao Xu, Yiran Peng, et al.

**Key Contribution**: Unified agent abstraction enabling automatic sub-agent creation with 16.28% performance improvement.

**Abstract**: Language agents have shown strong promise for task automation. Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple (Instruction, Context, Tools, Model). This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation.

**Impact**: Reduces human engineering efforts while enabling controllable performance-cost trade-offs, approaching Pareto-efficient agent orchestration.

### AutoFigure: Generating Publication-Ready Scientific Illustrations

**arXiv**: 2602.03828 • Submitted: Feb 3, 2026

**Authors**: Yixuan Weng et al.

**Key Contribution**: First agentic framework for automated high-quality scientific illustration generation from text.

**Abstract**: High-quality scientific illustrations are crucial for effectively communicating complex scientific and technical concepts, yet their manual creation remains a well-recognized bottleneck in both academia and industry. We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text.

**Impact**: Accepted at ICLR 2026 - addresses major bottleneck in scientific communication with agentic AI solution.

### Conformal Thinking: Risk Control for Reasoning on a Compute Budget

**arXiv**: 2602.03814 • Submitted: Feb 3, 2026

**Authors**: Xi Wang et al.

**Key Contribution**: Distribution-free risk control framework for adaptive reasoning with optimal token budget allocation.

**Abstract**: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) enable test-time scaling, with dataset-level accuracy improving as the token budget increases, motivating adaptive reasoning -- spending tokens when they improve reliability and stopping early when additional computation is unlikely to help. However, setting the token budget, as well as the threshold for adaptive reasoning, is a practical challenge that entails a fundamental risk-accuracy trade-off. We re-frame the budget setting problem as risk control, limiting the error rate while minimizing compute. Our framework introduces an upper threshold that stops reasoning when the model is confident (risking incorrect output) and a novel parametric lower threshold that preemptively stops unsolvable instances.

**Impact**: Enables computationally efficient reasoning while maintaining user-specified risk targets across diverse tasks and models.

### TodyComm: Task-Oriented Dynamic Communication for Multi-Round LLM-based Multi-Agent System

**arXiv**: 2602.03688 • Submitted: Feb 3, 2026

**Authors**: Wenzhe Fan et al.

**Key Contribution**: Dynamic communication topology that adapts to changing agent roles across rounds.

**Abstract**: Multi-round LLM-based multi-agent systems rely on effective communication structures to support collaboration across rounds. However, most existing methods employ a fixed communication topology during inference, which falls short in many realistic applications where the agents' roles may change across rounds due to dynamic adversary, task progression, or time-varying constraints such as communication bandwidth. We propose addressing this issue through TodyComm, a task-oriented dynamic communication algorithm that produces behavior-driven collaboration topologies that adapt to the dynamics at each round, optimizing the utility for the task through policy gradient.

**Impact**: Delivers superior task effectiveness under dynamic adversary and communication budget constraints while retaining token efficiency.
